# Long version #
In a **lab-based study**, researchers are generally able to use the same equipment (e.g., computer, microphone, headphones, etc) under the same conditions for all participants. Lab-based studies also allow researchers to determine whether the quality of the data collected has been affected by a given factor, such as how far a participant is sitting from the computer screen, or whether glare coming from a participant's glasses is preventing the eyetracker from working properly. In an **online study**, however, that level of control and homogeneity is impossible to achieve. As you know, with your permission, we will be accessing your webcam and microphone during some of the experimental tasks. Since each participant in our study will be using different equipment, we listed the settings which we believe will be the most optimal for the purposes of our experiment. We understand that not everyone will be able to follow our recommendation. Therefore, to be able to determine whether the quality of the data we are collecting will be affected by any different settings our participants will be using, we kindly ask you to answer a few additional questions on Gorilla. That information will allow us to

- **(a)** understand how our experiment was carried out in each individual context, and 
- **(b)** to improve our experimental paradigm in future projects.
